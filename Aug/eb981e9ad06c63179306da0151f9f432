We enclose herewith copy of a leaflet recently issued and distributed by the African National Congress in South Africa in reply to the South African Police statement that the African National Congress had been smashed.We also enclose copy of background material we have prepared in connexion with a campaign we are presently mounting for the release of Walter Sisulu and others. The campaign should be launched within the course of the next week or so. Our fear is that the South African Government is going to be very ruthless when sentencing these people. It is also our feeling that the Government is going to dramatize the whole matter in an effort to appease the White electorate.(Signed) Maindy MSIMANGAdministrative Officer,African National Congress of South Africa
